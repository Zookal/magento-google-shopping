## About

Google has retired its old Google Base Data API and replaced it with its new Google Content API for Shopping to let back-end staff more effectively
upload and manage product and catalog information. This extension allows developers to migrate their eCommerce stores into the new API to ensure that
they come up in Google searches.

- Replaces current Google Base API logic in Magento
- Allows developers to define which products are sent to Google
- Enables definition of how product attributes are mapped to Google
